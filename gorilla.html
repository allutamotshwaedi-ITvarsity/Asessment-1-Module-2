                            <h3>GORILLA</h3>
          <P>The gorilla is enormous! Mature males average around 400 pounds in the wild and the females around 200 pounds. Standing upright, males can sometimes measure up to six feet tall. The separate subspecies of gorilla differ slightly in appearance:
             Eastern gorillas tend to be darker in color, with longer hair, jaws and teeth. They also have shorter arms than their western gorilla relatives. The mountain gorilla has a robust build with long, muscular arms and short legs, a massive chest, and broad hands and feet with thick digits.
              Gorillas have large heads - especially males, who's sculls have a prominent crest. Adult males grow a crown of muscle and hair that makes the head look even longer. The fully grown adult male mountain gorilla is twice as large as the female.</P>
         <p>Gorillas are known to live in small family groups made up of altering numbers of males, females, infants, and juveniles. Each group is led by a dominant male gorilla. It is the dominant silverback's responsibility to protect his group and lead in the search for food.
            Typically, the females stay with the family, while the males leave their groups at adolescence. As a result, mothers, daughters, sisters, and grandmothers stick together in family groups. However, a different social structure is emerging among gorillas i.e. females leave their family and join other groups.
            Another behavioural trait the gorillas display, is that they try to defend one another when faced with danger. The death of a one gorilla also has a tremendous effect on the others, especially when the dominant silverback dies the family group may be severely disrupted.
            The group may split into two or more smaller groups. When a new silverback takes over a family group, he may kill all of the infants of the dead silverback. This is considered as an effective reproductive strategy since the new male conceives offspring that carry on his genes. In most harmonious groups, there is no clear evidence of infanticide.</p>
            <P>Gorillas are very intelligent and can learn tremendously complex tasks. Some gorillas have even been taught sign language by people and others have learned how to form simple sentences and communicate with people.Mountain gorillas are primarily vegetarians. They eat various types of plants, including the roots and stems of some plants, the leaves and flowers of other plants, and even the bark of certain trees. They also eat the fruit of several types of trees and vines, wild celery, thistles, the tender shoots of bamboo plants, and certain vines in their entirety.</P>
            <p>Gorillas are known to make many sounds. Over 25 distinct sounds have been documented. Some of them include:
            Hooting, plant slapping, and beating of the chest, sometimes accompanied by prancing
            Sharp grunting: a sign of disapproval
            Chuckling: a sign of playfulness
            Screaming: a sign of alarm or warning
            High-pitched barking: a sign of curiosity
            Roaring: a sign of aggression
            Belching: a sign of contentment</p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
        <p>You will find the Gorrilas at Secction E20, opposite Monkey Trail</p>
