                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
          <P>Giraffes are the tallest mammals on Earth. Their legs alone are taller than many humans—about 6 feet.They can run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances, or cruise at 10 mph over longer distances.The giraffe is the tallest animal in the world, attaining a height of 5.5m, its incredibly long neck accounting for much of its height. The long neck has resulted in a complex blood circulatory system, which is not yet fully understood by zoologists.

            Adult males generally reach a height of about 5 metres and females about 4,5 metres. Big males can weigh a massive 1 200 kilograms while females usually weigh some 800 to 900 kilograms. Their skin colour is tan with light brown patches on females and dark brown patches on males. Both males and females have short horns covered in skin.</P> 
        
          <p>A giraffe's neck is too short to reach the ground. As a result, it has to awkwardly spread its front legs or kneel to reach the ground for a drink of water.Giraffes are generally quiet animals that go about their business with an air of serenity. Occasionally, when disturbed, they will snort and, when attacked by predators, they bellow.</p>
          <p>Giraffes spend most of their lives standing up; they even sleep and give birth standing. Despite the females’ attempts to stand over their calves during attacks by lions, spotted hyenas, leopards and African wild dogs (4), many calves are killed in their first few monthsp.Giraffes only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period! They often achieve that in quick naps that may last only a minute or two at a time</p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
        <p>You will find the Giraffe at C23. Next to the Bears.</p>
